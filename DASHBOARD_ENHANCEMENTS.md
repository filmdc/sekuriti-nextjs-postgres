### Design Patterns

#### Widget Architecture
- **Consistent Props Interface**: All widgets follow a standardized prop structure
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading for improved perceived performance
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling in widget components
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA labels

#### Mobile-First Responsive Design
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile usability
- **Grid Layouts**: CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints
- **Typography**: Scalable font sizes with proper contrast ratios
- **Navigation**: Swipe-friendly card interactions

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading of widget components
- **Debounced Search**: Reduced API calls with 300ms debounce
- **Memoization**: React.memo for widget re-render optimization
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shaking for minimal bundle size

## Security-Focused Features

### Information Hierarchy
1. **Critical Alerts** - Immediate attention items
2. **Active Incidents** - Ongoing security events
3. **Asset Status** - Infrastructure protection overview
4. **Team Activity** - Collaborative response tracking
5. **Runbook Execution** - Procedure compliance monitoring

### Visual Indicators
- **Severity Color Coding**: Red (Critical), Orange (High), Yellow (Medium), Blue (Low)
- **Status Badges**: Clear indication of current states
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress tracking for ongoing activities
- **Trend Arrows**: Up/down indicators for metric trends

### Quick Actions
- **Incident Reporting**: One-click incident creation
- **Asset Management**: Direct access to asset inventory
- **Runbook Access**: Quick procedure lookup
- **Training Modules**: Immediate access to security training

## Mobile Optimizations

### Touch-Friendly Interface
